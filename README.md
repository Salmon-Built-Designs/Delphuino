# Delphuino
Boost controller, wideband controller, and more piggyback system for GM Gen3 LS PCMs. (Delphi/Arduino...Delphuino).
Wideband controller is based of the SLC Free 2 controller from 14Point7. Doesn't include the LCD circuit and instead uses the analog output to arduino.
Visit the link below on details to the open source controller info. Under Open Source Documents will have the PCB and open source info.

You will need a MiniProg 3 programmer from Cypress to flash the hex files to the CY8 chip for wideband support.
I plan to make the board availble pre programmed with the CY8 chip installed for self assembly.
